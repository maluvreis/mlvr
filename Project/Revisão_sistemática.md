## 1. Introduction ##

 Early and accurate diagnosis of thyroid nodules is essential due to their high prevalence in the population and the possibility of malignancy. According to Paulino et al. (2020) Thyroid nodules are common findings on imaging exams, and although the majority are benign, the identification of malignant nodules is crucial to starting appropriate treatment as early as possible, thus improving the patient's prognosis and quality of life. Furthermore, an accurate diagnosis allows unnecessary invasive procedures to be avoided in patients with benign nodules, providing a more personalized and effective therapeutic approach.
 As Chamberlaim et al (2023) and Lobo (2017) mention in their publications, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in diagnostic medicine has grown significantly. These tools process large amounts of medical data, such as exam images, to assist in the interpretation and diagnosis of diseases. With increasingly advanced algorithms, AI can identify patterns and anomalies, providing more accurate and faster diagnoses. This technology is becoming essential for improving the efficiency and accuracy of medical diagnoses.
 This systematic review is of great importance for supporting research, as it offers an understanding of the current state of scientific literature, identifying knowledge gaps and directing research precisely. This review will be the theoretical basis for the work, generating new knowledge in this rapidly evolving area of ​​diagnostic medicine.
     

## 2. Methodology ##

 ### 2.1. Definition of study inclusion and exclusion criteria.
 
**Inclusion criteria:**
1. Studies that address the development or evaluation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for thyroid ultrasound reports.
2. Articles that use TI-RADS (Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System) to classify nodules.
3. Articles more related to report production.
4. Research involving the application of AI techniques for the detection, classification, or prognosis of thyroid nodules.
5. Studies published in English, Spanish or Portuguese.
6. Articles published in the last 5 years to ensure relevance and timeliness.

**Exclusion criteria:**
1. Studies that do not directly relate to the development or evaluation of AI tools for thyroid ultrasound scans.
2. Articles that do not use TI-RADS to classify nodules.
3. Research that does not involve the application of AI techniques in the analysis of thyroid ultrasound exams.
4. Studies published in languages ​​other than those specified in the inclusion criteria.
5. Outdated or non-peer reviewed articles.
6. Studies with small samples or conventional methodologies that compromise the quality of the results.

### 2.2 Database search strategy

 The databases chosen were PubMed, Scielo, Web of Science and Google Scholar, this choice is justified by the wide coverage and consolidated reputation. These platforms are recognized for indexing a wide range of scientific literature, including high-impact journals and peer-reviewed articles, making them reliable sources of information. The search focuses on key terms related to the production of thyroid ultrasound imaging reports, such as thyroid ultrasound, artificial intelligence, TI-RADS, and nodule classification. These terms are adapted as needed for each specific database and its languages, ensuring a comprehensive and accurate search. The objective is to identify relevant studies that address the development and evaluation of AI tools for the production of thyroid ultrasound reports, with a focus on the application of TI-RADS for the classification of nodules. These studies will be fundamental to support both the systematic review and the master's research, providing a solid evidence base for the proposed work.
As described in Oliveira’s class notes (2019), the following strategies were followed:

**PubMed**:
   - The PubMed search was essential due to its vast coverage of medical literature, including renowned scientific journals and peer-reviewed articles.
   - The search strategy in PubMed involved terms related to thyroid ultrasound and its reports, artificial intelligence, TI-RADS and nodule classification.
 

 **Scielo**:
   - Scielo is a database that includes a large amount of scientific literature.
   - The search strategy was to follow the same terms used in PubMed, with adjustments to equivalent terms in English or Portuguese, when necessary.
 
**Web of Science**:
   - Web of Science is a comprehensive platform that indexes a wide variety of scientific journals, allowing detailed searching.
   - The search strategy in Web of Science was similar to that used in PubMed, with the advantage of being able to access different journals and conferences.
   

**Google Scholar**:
   - Google Scholar is useful for finding articles from a wide range of sources, including theses, dissertations, and open access articles.
   - The search on Google Scholar was more generic, using the main search terms, but at times required additional filtering of results.

The search strategy was related to the work through the selection of relevant terms and keywords, such as "thyroid ultrasound", "Thyroid reports", "artificial intelligence", "TI-RADS", "TI-RADS reports", "nodule classification", among others. These terms were logically combined with Boolean operators (AND, OR) to reflect the scope of the search. For example, a search could include the terms "thyroid ultrasound AND artificial intelligence AND TI-RADS."

### 2.3 Development of AI Tools for Thyroid Ultrasound Reports

  **2.3.1 Description of the artificial intelligence techniques used in the selected studies.**
  
  Studies related to the development and evaluation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for thyroid ultrasound exam reports, with the application of TI-RADS to classify nodules, often use advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. NLP is an area of ​​AI that allows computer systems to understand, interpret and generate human language in a way similar to how humans understand it.
  Machine Learning and Neural Networks: These techniques are widely used in AI studies related to thyroid ultrasound reports. Machine learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are trained with large datasets of ultrasound images to learn patterns that can identify and classify thyroid nodules based on specific characteristics such as shape, texture, and echostructure (KIM et al. al.,2021).
 Image Processing: In addition to PLN, image processing is an essential part of these studies. Techniques such as image segmentation and feature extraction are used to identify regions of interest in ultrasound exams and extract relevant information about the nodules.    
 Feature Extraction: PLN is used to extract relevant features from ultrasound reports. Reports are analyzed to identify key terms such as nodule size, shape, echogenicity, and margins that are important for classification according to TI-RADS. 
 Language Models and Text Processing: Language models, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), are used to understand the text of ultrasound reports and interpret relevant information about nodules. 
  Text processing is employed to translate reports into structured data that can be used by classification algorithms. These artificial intelligence techniques, especially in the context of natural language processing, are crucial for the development of effective tools for thyroid ultrasound reports, providing a more accurate and automated analysis of nodules and contributing to more advanced and efficient diagnostic medicine.
